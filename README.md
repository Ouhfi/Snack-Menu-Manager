<h2 align="center">🍔 Snack Menu Manager</h2>

<p align="center">
  A Full Stack application that helps snack owners manage their menu with automatic background synchronization and offline support.
</p>




A **Full Stack** application that allows snack owners to manage their menu through a REST API and an Expo mobile application.

The application continues to work even without an Internet connection thanks to **background synchronization** and **local caching**.

# 📖 Overview

This project was developed as part of a learning program.

Its goal is to provide a complete solution for snack owners to easily manage their menu from a mobile application.

The project consists of two parts:

* **Backend:** REST API built with Express and PostgreSQL.
* **Mobile:** Expo application powered by TanStack Query with background synchronization.

The main focus of this project is:

* Clean architecture
* API documentation
* Data caching
* Offline support
* Automatic background synchronization

---

# 🗄 Database Schema

Table: **dishes**

| Column     | Type               |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| id         | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY |
| name       | VARCHAR(100)       |
| price      | NUMERIC(6,2)       |
| category   | VARCHAR(50)        |
| available  | BOOLEAN            |

# 🚀 REST API

| Method | Endpoint       | Description            |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| GET    | /api/plats     | Retrieve all dishes    |
| GET    | /api/plats/:id | Retrieve a single dish |
| POST   | /api/plats     | Create a new dish      |
| PUT    | /api/plats/:id | Update a dish          |
| DELETE | /api/plats/:id | Delete a dish          |

# 📚 API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available using **Scalar UI**.

```text
http://localhost:3000/docs
```

The documentation includes:

* Endpoint descriptions
* Parameters
* Request bodies
* Response examples
* HTTP status codes
* Usage examples

# 🔄 Background Synchronization

The core feature of this project is a background synchronization task.

How it works:

1. Expo Task Manager registers a background task.
2. Expo Background Task schedules its execution based on the operating system.
3. The application fetches the latest menu from the REST API.
4. The retrieved data is stored in AsyncStorage.
5. The synchronization timestamp is saved.
6. If the network is unavailable, cached data is loaded instead.
7. Users can also trigger synchronization manually.

---

# 📱 Offline Mode

Whenever the server or Internet connection is unavailable:

* Data is loaded from AsyncStorage.
* A banner informs the user that the application is running in offline mode.
* The last successful synchronization time is displayed.
